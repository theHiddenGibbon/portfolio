    <h3>Semantic HTML & Responsive Layout</h3>
    <p>
      I translated the prototypes into code structure using semantic HTML5 to ensure accessibility and a CSS Grid system to ensure consistency and responsiveness.
    </p>

    <h3>React & State Management</h3>
    <p>
      Using React, I created a modular front-end architecture. I built a table reservation system that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Captures user input via forms with validation for ease of input and data integrity. Providing clear direction and feedback for a smooth user experience.</li>
      <li>Updates and manages app state in real-time</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>
      I was pleased with my final product. It:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Is fully functional, responsive, and accessible</li>
      <li>Solves real user pain points</li>
      <li>Uses scalable components and best practices in design and front-end code</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      My user personas were of course all delighted with the new system as it addressed all of the complaints and concerns that they had raised (even if they are all fictional and biased).
    </p>

    <p>I have a live working version of my <a href="" target="_blank">Little Lemon project</a> that you can see for yourself.</p>
    <p>The code can also be found in my <a href="https://github.com/theHiddenGibbon/little-lemon" target="_blank">GitHub repository.</a></p>
