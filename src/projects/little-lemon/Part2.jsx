    <h3>Wireframing</h3>
    <p>
      I created low-fidelity wireframes in Figma to explore layout options and user flows. These were informed by both user needs and business goals, balancing usability with business requirements.
    </p>
    <p>Visuals: Mobile wireframes</p>

    <h3>Design System Thinking & Prototyping</h3>
    <p>
      Using the restaurantâ€™s brand guidelines, I developed a style guide and identified reusable design components. These were added to a component library in Figma.
    </p>
    <p>I then created high-fidelity prototypes, ensuring:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visual and interactive consistency</li>
      <li>Accessibility</li>
      <li>Responsive design for both desktop and mobile</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Visuals: Style guide, components, high-fidelity prototypes, final layouts</p>
