    <h3>Reflections</h3>
    <p>
      Overall I found the project to be a valuable opportunity to apply everything I learned into one end to end process.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the scope didnâ€™t allow for true iterative process through testing and stakeholder collaboration, it helped me understand the structure of a real-world product design workflow.
      Whilst I have not previously been involved in those processes from a design point of view, I have experience working in Agile and Sprint environments from other perspectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now look forward to joining a professional team where I will be able to contribute to real world projects, and continue to grow and learn.
      Until then, I am continuing my studies and working on other projects to add to my portfolio.
