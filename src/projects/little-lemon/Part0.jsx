    <h2>Case Study: Little Lemon Restaurant Web App</h2>
    <p>Role: UX/UI Designer & Front-End Developer</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      This capstone project was completed as part of the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate.
      The objective was to design and develop a responsive, user-friendly web application for Little Lemon,
      a Mediterranean restaurant whose customers were frustrated by the lack of an easy online table reservation system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project demonstrates my ability to work across the full product development lifecycleâ€”from user research
      to design system thinking to front-end development.
    </p>
    <p>Tools & Technologies: Figma, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Git, GitHub</p>
